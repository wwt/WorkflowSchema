## Pull Requests
PRs have a checklist that walks you through the things that you should do for any PR. This document provides greater detail and context around what some of those checklist items mean. Please take the time to read through this document and our styleguide before contributing so that we can keep SwiftCurrentSchema clean, and maintainable. By the time you submit code we want to be focused on the logic, not the formatting, or patterns.
